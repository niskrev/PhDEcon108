## Course description
This is a course in time series econometrics with a focus on the models and methods used in empirical macroeconomics. The emphasis of the course will be on applying these tools in practice, rather than on than underlying econometric theory. To that end, we will try to implement everything covered in lectures by writing computer programs. The language of instruction used in the course is [Python](https://www.python.org/). No previous programming experience with Python is assumed. However, students are expected to quickly familiarize themselves with the basics of the language by working through the material and completing the exercises that will be provided. The course will be taught using a mixture of online lectures and hands-on programming sessions.

## Course outline
Please note that the following outline is preliminary and may be modified if needed.

## Textbooks and other readings
There is no required textbook for this course. All necessary material (slides, lecture notes and programming demos) will be posted on the course web site.  There are several freely available online books that I will sometimes make reference to, but none of them is mandatory:
   * [Econometrics](https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~bhansen/econometrics/Econometrics.pdf) (textbook by B. Hansen, chapters 14, 15, 16)
   * [Advanced Data Analysis from an Elementary Point of View](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/ADAfaEPoV/ADAfaEPoV.pdf) (textbook by C. Shalizi, chapter 23)
   * [Econometric Theory and Methods](http://qed.econ.queensu.ca/ETM/ETM-davidson-mackinnon-2021.pdf)  (textbook by Davidson and MacKinnon, chapters 13, 14)
   * [Introduction to Python for Econometrics, Statistics and Numerical Analysis](https://www.kevinsheppard.com/files/teaching/python/notes/python_introduction_2021.pdf)  (notes by K. Sheppard)
   * [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) (book by J. VanderPlas, chapters 2, 3, 4)


## Important course information

Course assignments will be posted on 


Class meetings will be held on Zoom. You will need a microphone and webcam (you need not always have your webcam on, but you will want to be able to be visible at times). 


## Course goals

* Learn
* Learn how to write code for time series data analysis using the Python and Jupyter Notebooks
* Fit time series models to data and evaluate their performance, and interpret the results of social behavioral experiments




## Grading

Grades will be determined as follows: homework assignments (70%), midterm project (15%), final project (15%).

## Late Submissions
No.
