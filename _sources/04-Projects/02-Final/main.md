# Final project

## Description
The final project is to replicate, using Python, a published article containing interesting time series analysis.

I will provide a list of possible articles for you to consider, but you're free to replicate others of your choosing. However, the original article should not be accompanied by code in Python. You will have to send me a brief description of what you propose to do, and I will approve each project. There can be no two projects replicating the same article, and the approval will be given on a first-come-first-served basis.
