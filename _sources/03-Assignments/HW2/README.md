# README HW2

## Tasks
Follow the instructions in HW2-part1.ipynb, HW2-part2.ipynb, and HW2-part3.ipynb, in that order.

## Submission
Submit as a folder with name HW2 (containing the completed notebooks and the two plots produced by the end as png files) in a repository called `HWs-first-last` (replace with  your names) which you create at [https://github.com/PhDEcon108](https://github.com/PhDEcon108). Make it a public or private repo, but if you choose private, add me as a collaborator (go to the repo's Settings -> Collaborators and teams -> add people, and then type niskrev). One possible way to start is by first creating the private repository at [https://github.com/PhDEcon108](https://github.com/PhDEcon108), then clone to your laptops, complete the work, push to Github, and then make the repo public, or add me as collaborator. A private repo can be changed to a public one by going to the repo's Settings, and click on Change visibility near the bottom (in the Danger Zone!)
