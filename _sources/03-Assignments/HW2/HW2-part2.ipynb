You could duplicate that notebook (right click on the name of a notebook anc choose Duplicate, or press Ctrl+d), replace the list of subindices and then run the remaining cells. However, this is not very efficient and violates a basic principle of programming, known as __DRY__ - don't repeat yourself. A better approach is to write functions and automate, whenever possible, tasks which are repeated.\n",
