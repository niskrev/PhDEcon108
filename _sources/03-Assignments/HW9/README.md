# Homework 9


## Tasks

### Part 1

Read Chapter 29 of [this notes](https://www.kevinsheppard.com/files/teaching/python/notes/python_introduction_2021.pdf) for an accessible intro to OOP in Python.


### Part 2

Read the `statsmodels` docs on specifying custom state space models [here](https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/examples/notebooks/generated/statespace_custom_models.html). Type and execute the code for Model 1 and 2 as presented. Make the necessary changes to Model 1 to estimate a time-varying parameter model with only __one__ regressor. Simulate data with that model and use your custom model to estimate it. This is the only part of this homework you need to submit.


### Part 3

Read through [this post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71859815/smoothed-state-disturbances-in-statsmodels-state-space-model) in stackoverflow. Type and run all example code.
